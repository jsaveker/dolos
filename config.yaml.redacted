# (Optional) Feature gates are used to enable experimental features
# bootstrap_feature_gates:
#   # Enable Dual Stack IPv4 first
#   # IMPORTANT: I am looking for people to help maintain IPv6 support since I cannot test it.
#   #   Ref: https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template/issues/1148
#   # Keep in mind that Cilium does not currently support IPv6 L2 announcements.
#   # Make sure you set cluster.pod_cidr and cluster.service_cidr
